# LifeLine
My first project that I want to complete fully.

This program will take a photo from webcam in random time every day. Then you can make a video from photos, which accumulated for the year and view it.

The program uses the OpenCV library. Here two *.props, which can help you to add OpenCV to your project on Visual Studio.

I try to use this code convention http://www.codingstandard.com/section/index/

# TODO
    - Task manager (executor) instead internal cycle. (store priority(by start time) queue of tasks)
    - Checking on face (maybe align on center) before making a snapshot
    - Create the tray icon with menu (Settings, Exit)
